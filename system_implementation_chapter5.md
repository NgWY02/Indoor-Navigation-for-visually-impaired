### 5.3.3 Supabase Configuration

Supabase serves as the backend-as-a-service platform, providing authentication, database, and storage capabilities for the indoor navigation system. The configuration integrates seamlessly with the Flutter application through the `supabase_flutter` package.

#### Authentication Configuration

The Supabase authentication is configured in the Flutter application initialization:

```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await dotenv.load();

  final supabaseService = SupabaseService();
  await supabaseService.initialize();

  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

The SupabaseService initialization includes:
```dart
Future<void> initialize() async {
  await Supabase.initialize(
    url: dotenv.env['SUPABASE_URL']!,
    anonKey: dotenv.env['SUPABASE_ANON_KEY']!,
  );

  await _initializeStorage();
}
```

#### Environment Configuration

The application uses environment variables for Supabase configuration, stored in a `.env` file:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# Optional: Additional configuration
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

#### Database Schema and Row Level Security

The Supabase database implements a multi-tenant architecture with comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies:

**Core Tables and Relationships**
- **profiles**: User accounts linked to organizations
- **organizations**: Multi-tenant data isolation containers
- **maps**: Indoor environment representations
- **map_nodes**: Physical locations with coordinate data
- **place_embeddings**: AI-generated visual signatures
- **node_connections**: Navigable pathways between locations
- **navigation_paths**: Complete routes with waypoint sequences
- **path_waypoints**: Sequential navigation points with embeddings

**Row Level Security Policies**
```sql
-- Organization-based access control
ALTER TABLE maps ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Users can access maps from their organization"
ON maps FOR ALL USING (organization_id IN (
  SELECT organization_id FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()
));
```

#### Storage Configuration

Supabase Storage is configured with dedicated buckets for different content types:

```dart
Future<void> _initializeStorage() async {
  try {
    await _createBucketIfNotExists('maps');
    await _createBucketIfNotExists('place_images');
  } catch (e) {
    print('Storage initialization error: $e');
  }
}
```

**Storage Buckets**
- **maps**: Floor plan images and building layouts
- **place_images**: Navigation waypoint photographs
- **user_uploads**: User-generated content and custom images

#### Real-time Subscriptions

The application leverages Supabase's real-time capabilities for live updates:

```dart
final subscription = supabase
  .channel('navigation_paths')
  .onPostgresChanges(
    event: PostgresChangeEvent.all,
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'navigation_paths',
    callback: (payload) => updateNavigationState(payload),
  )
  .subscribe();
```

#### Authentication Flow Integration

The Supabase authentication integrates with Flutter's navigation system:

```dart
void _handleDeepLink(Uri uri) {
  final params = Uri.splitQueryString(uri.fragment);
  final accessToken = params['access_token'];
  final refreshToken = params['refresh_token'];

  if (accessToken != null && refreshToken != null) {
    if (uri.path.contains('reset')) {
      _navigateToNewPasswordScreen(accessToken, refreshToken);
    } else {
      _handleEmailConfirmation(accessToken, refreshToken);
    }
  }
}
```

#### Performance Optimization

The Supabase configuration includes several performance optimization strategies:

**Database Indexing**
- Foreign key relationships are automatically indexed
- Composite indexes on frequently queried columns
- Partial indexes for active records

**Connection Pooling**
- Automatic connection management through Supabase client
- Request batching for multiple database operations
- Connection reuse for improved performance

**Caching Strategy**
- Local caching of frequently accessed data
- Offline queue for network-dependent operations
- Selective synchronization based on data freshness

#### Monitoring and Analytics

Supabase provides built-in monitoring capabilities:

```dart
// Query performance monitoring
final response = await supabase
  .from('navigation_paths')
  .select()
  .explain(); // Shows query execution plan

// Real-time metrics
final metrics = await supabase
  .rest
  .rpc('get_database_metrics');
```

#### Security Configuration

The Supabase setup implements multiple security layers:

**API Key Management**
- Public anonymous key for client-side operations
- Service role key for server-side administrative tasks
- Environment-based key rotation

**Network Security**
- HTTPS-only communication
- CORS configuration for mobile app connectivity
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

**Data Encryption**
- Automatic encryption of sensitive data at rest
- TLS 1.3 encryption for data in transit
- Secure key management for encryption operations

This comprehensive configuration ensures secure, scalable, and performant backend services for the indoor navigation system, supporting both real-time navigation and administrative management functions.
